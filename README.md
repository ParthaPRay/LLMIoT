# LLMIoT
This repo shows the coding of ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino MKR 1000 to have communication with local LLMs on Raspberry Pi 4B

This work presents a novel framework that works to establish connection among IoT devices with localized resource-constrained edge like Raspberry PI 4B by using FastAPI+ Ollama frameworks and local LLMs.

Three codes for IoT clients are desiged to commnicated to local LLM web server.
